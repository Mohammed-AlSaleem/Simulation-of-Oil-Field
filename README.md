# Simulation-of-Oil-Field
ISE 405 Simulation Course Project

## Introduction:
Aramco is planning to do a new strategy in which they build new tiny and partial oil
and gas fields instead of increasing the production in the current fields they have. The first
step is to discover areas that have a profitable underground source of crude oil. Currently
Aramco produces 5,400,000 bbl/day. Shaybah Oil Field produces 1,000,000 bbl/day. It is
believed that there is a nearby source from it and Aramco determined a budget of a maximum
capacity of 40,000 bbl/day. They want to make sure that this new and tiny field being
profitable as much as possible. Testing the plan in this field in real life is costly and needs a
lot of time. So, doing a simulation for the partial field is a good solution for this situation.
One stage of the field process decided to be simulated to conduct tests on it (conducting
several scenarios) to maximizes the Profit. This stage is called the blending stage where the
crude oil is going through three main processes: Distillation, cracking and finally blending.
Distillation is a process that assures that the crude oil is pure to guarantee the required
quality. It is divided into some sub-processes: Distillation column, condenser and reflex drum
as shown in Figure 1. The next process is cracking, where the crude oil must be all liquid
(solids are thrown away) and that can be done by breaking the Carbon-Carbon bonds of the
crude oil. The final process is the blending, where the crude oil is divided into six main
categories (based on the Octan Number ON) as a result of the two previous processes. They
can be represented by (Xij) Where (i) represents the input steam (2 steams) and (j) represents
the final products (3 final products). Final Products are the result of blending two main
categories. The three final product has a different selling price. Products 1, 2 and 3 can be
sold by 25.125, 27.000 and 30.375 SR/bbl, respectively. The purpose is to increase the profit
of the partial field by changing the model parameters (e.g. The cracking ratio) and the
working times.

## Objectives:
Simulation is an efficient tool to test and check a model and try different scenarios to
have the maximum profit from the crude oil blending before building the model physically,
especially for expensive models. In this project, we tested different scenarios of the working
time, and the ratios of the crude oil that comes from the distillation tower to the cracker and
blender to have the maximum profit and high quality from selling different products with a
different octan number (ON).
